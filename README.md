# GuitHub - A React Music Lesson Lab
This app provides a one-page interface that makes it easy to search and save videos for your music practicing goals. The flexible but guided search parameters keep the video results related to learning more about your instrument of choice. Save a custom playlist with notes as a lesson plan to make repeat practice easy to reference without leaving the page. Keep different lesson plans for different goals, for instance your jazz flute practice is separate from your folk guitar goals. Share videos and lesson plans with friends. Rock on!
