This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# React-Music-Lesson-Lab
A web hub for your favorite music lesson videos. For any playing level and all of your music goals.

This project will utilize a MERN stack to provide a single page intuitive interface for music students of any sort to search, browse, and save the videos they like best to learn with. 

##### Additional features will include:
* in-built metronome and tuner
* video controls interface
* sharing
* goals folders for different styles or instruments
* notepad
* build-your-own lesson plan
* Publsh a lesson plan
* progress reports, show today's topic searches and have player rate their progress to later show improvement
** maybe something like, here are all the videos you studied today. Which were too easy? Which were too hard? Mark the proportions and what level they were choosing to search with to get metrics that do not ask a player to rate themself
