A web hub for your favorite music lesson videos. For any playing level and all of your music goals.

This project will utilize a MERN stack to provide a single page intuitive interface for music students of any sort to search, browse, and save the videos they like best to learn with. 

##### Additional features will include:
* in-built metronome and tuner
* video controls interface
* sharing
* goals folders for different styles or instruments
* notepad
* build-your-own lesson plan
* Publsh a lesson plan
* progress reports, show today's topic searches and have player rate their progress to later show improvement
** maybe something like, here are all the videos you studied today. Which were too easy? Which were too hard? Mark the proportions and what level they were choosing to search with to get metrics that do not ask a player to rate themself
